# todo-2022 / Minimalistic To-do List

A few years ago, when I was jsut starting to learn how to coding, I wrote a very simple to-do list with basic html, css and javascript knowledge.
After that, I mostly use javascript library/framework to do the projects. But somehow I miss the goold old vanilla javascript, so I decide to play with basic html/css/javascript to write again the to-do list. Okay, not css, I use sass 🙈.

### Features

- user can add a task via input section
- user can check the task
- user can uncheck the done task
- user can delete the task

Yes, that is that 'minimalistic'👏.
